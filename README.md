## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
- The MBTA database management system project involves the development and implementation
of a centralized database to store and manage information related to the operations of the MBTA.
This can include data on routes, ticketing, finances and operations. The goal of the project is to
provide a single source of truth for all relevant data and to improve the efficiency and accuracy
of MBTA operations.
- This System facilitates functionalities like buying and top up- of tickets, pass as well as charlie
cards, checking the status of the cards and their expiry dates, showing the stations for the transits,
also the transactions in the stations with their timestamps and value. In Addition, the system also
shows the operations whether the line and station is active or inactive due to construction or any
other difficulties so that it's easy for the people to travel as well as it helps solve business
problems and gather reports.

## OBJECTIVE 

1. To design a relational database that can storeï¼Œmanage, and retrieve MBTA information
about stations, cards, tickets, recharging, check-in and lines in a secure and efficient
manner.
2. The database should be able to provide information to monitor everyday operations,
provide an overview of business statistics over a period, and help identify potential
growth points for the MBTA system.
3. The system should enable commuting via various recharge types i.e., Rides, Passes and
Wallet balance top up.
4. The system should discard/detect fraudulent transactions made by 3rd party intrusions by
identifying the recharge device used for the recharge action.


### Steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the github repository.

2. Run DDL_DML_scripts.sql file to execute DDL and DML queries  

3. To create views run queries from Views.sql 

4. Run Security_roles.sql file to grant user permissions on database objects and assets

5. Working on Stored_procedures.sql(In Process)
